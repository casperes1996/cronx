# cronx

cronx allows you to run commands from your crontab immediately, both specific line numbers as well as any command in the crontab.
It can also read out lines from the file, or the whole file with line numbers.

It's a simple program written in Swift. It is tested that it can be compiled and run on macOS as well as Ubuntu 20.04
</br>
Binary versions can be added by request but compiling it from source should be straightforward. Let me know if you want binary versions though.
</br>
Oh and don't judge the source code too hard ;). It was knocked out in one night since a friend could use a tool like this and it seemed like something good to make. Wasn't super worried about following all best practices.
